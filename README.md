# Todoey

Todoey is a simple, colourful to-do list app that allows you to set up categories and to-do’s for each category. Your to-do data is persisted using Realm’s database.

Todoey uses well-known iOS animations, including swipe-to-delete, to provide a natural UI for the user to interact with.
It also includes typical technologies you’d expect to use in an iOS app, such as UIAlertController and UITableViewController.

Todoey was one of the first projects I worked on, yet it probably became the most important. It helped me understand for the very first time the foundations of any iOS app, including working with tableviews, presenting alerts and persisting data.
